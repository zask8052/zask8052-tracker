# zask8052-tracker

My name is Zander, and in this README file, I will document my process in creating my Web Design Prototype, based on the Design Prompt of 'Media Consumption'. For this prompt, I chose to create a 'Video Game Review' data tracking application. In order to run my site on the local server I have created, please type in the console "npm run start", then in a browser, go to: http://localhost:8888 . This will activate the server.

Firstly, I went through the process of creating a repository, utilising GitHub and Node.js to set it up. I followed the in-class instructions, only coming across one issue, being that the local server was not connecting, which was swiftly fixed once I asked the tutor for assistance.

After this I began building the website's structure using HTML. I first looked at my Design Concept created for my previous assessment task, in which I was tasked in designing the possible layout for this tracking site, seen here:

In this design, I chose to utilise a number of various data models, which I aimed to include in this website. These data models are shown in this table:

After my repository was created, I then looked back at the work I had done in-class, namely the task tracker we each created. I based my beginning code off of this project, and began adding and changing things to better suit the form I wanted to create. Due to my original code being in replit, I edited a lot of the beginning code in that program, before sending it over to VSCode. During this process however, I left the 'star rating' component of my form out for now, in order to edit it in VSCode, to record my progress in figuring out how to create it as I commit my changes.

After transferring my code to VSCode, I then had to research how to create a star rating, as seen in my initial design, in a way that could be integrated into a form so that users could pick a rating, and see it displayed next to their other data once submitted. I first tried utilising code from 'https://dev.to/grahamthedevrel/5-star-rating-system-actually-accessible-no-js-no-wai-aria-3idl', to create the stars, and this ended up functioning and looking fine, however, since it was not my own code, it would be more difficult for me to control the parameters, and therefore customise it to be were I want it to be, and act how I want it to act. Instead, I chose to then research how to change the appearance of radio input options in order for them to look like stars, making it easier for my workflow, and a better fit within my code.

After many different tries, with varying applications, ideas and problems, I ended up creating the star rating system in the form, which can be interacted with like a regular star rating UI. However, I came across some issues when creating this, as first, an extra star would appear next to the "Rating" title, that was hoverable, but not clickable. I debugged for quite a while before realising it was a problem with the CSS styling an extra star next to the title, due to the placement of the div command. I fixed this by giving the label its own div, seperating it from the starRating div, and getting rid of the extra star. One element of this that I could not figure out however, and something that could be improved on if future developers were to try improving the tracker, was the transferring of the "star-rating" visually from the form to the tracking list. I could only figure out how to display the number of stars given, but not the stars themselves.

After this, I then set my focus on CSS styling, changing the layout to fit more with my original site design proposal. During this process, I changed the positioning, font and font size of the site's text, preparing to shift everything around to how I wanted the form to look. I then went into the JavaScript, and utilised different styling techiniques to achieve a simplistic list to show the tracked items. I utilised the '&nbsp;' or "non-breaking space" entity, as well as '/br', as I did not want the list to keep breaking after every category. This was for two main reasons, first being that I didn't think it would look as aesthetically pleasing if not utilised, and secondly, it is better for accessibility, as those who utilise screen readers can more easily go through their own lists without as much to press. Speaking of accessibility, the "label" tag was also utilised for this same reason in relation to screen readers as well.

For possible future developers of this application, I have multiple changes I would suggest they make, chief among them being further enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the form, as my skills in converting complex unicode such as my rating system, would be more limited than those with much more experience than me in JS. Future developers could also improve the media query I created in order to better fit mobile devices. An extension of the concept could also be the ability to further journal thoughts on each game, through a 'review' section, which could even be expanded to be shareable with friends, creating a unique online social environment.

Throughout the process of creating this site, I consistently made 'commits' to my repository, through first adding ("git add."), then committing, adding a small comment to each commit describing what has changed between that and the last ("git commit -m "text_here""), and then finally pushing the data to the GitHub server ("git push").

In the creation of this assignment, I have learned many lessons, gaining much more confidence in not just HTML and CSS, but JavaScript, as before going into this process, I had learned more about all three, especially the latter, than I had thought I would. Web Design was also a key learning point, as in the initial design phases of this site, I research many Information Architecture techniques which I aimed to include in this prototype. Going forward, I will aim to carry these lessons with me, further informing future decisions and creations, opening up my own view of what I can create using the elements of Programming as well as Web Design.
